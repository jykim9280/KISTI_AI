(◯신기남 의원 의석에서 ― 예.)  방송국 인․허가의 위헌 문제, 이 문제는 저는 형법을 공부한 사람이고 신 의원은 저명한 변호사이기 때문에 저보다 더 잘 아시리라고 생각합니다. 현행 헌법 21조제2항은 언론 출판에 관한 문제를 다루고 있고 제21조3항은 ｢방송과 통신의 경우에는 그 설립기준을 법률로써 정한다｣ 이렇게 되어 있습니다. 법률로 위임을 해놓았기 때문에 공보처장관에게 그 추천권이 주어져 있습니다. 이것이 위헌이냐 아니냐를 정확하게 제가 판단을 해 보지 않았습니다. 그러나 아까 중동 이외에 몇 군데밖에는 그런 것이 없다 이런 말씀을 하셨는데 제가 아는 한 미국에서 연방행정기구에서 방송국 설립 허가권이 있습니다. 8년마다 갱신하는 것으로 알고 있습니다.  간략하게 답변드렸습니다. 국무위원석에 지금 국무위원 아닌 분들이 앉아 계신 분 계세요? 국무위원 아닌 분은 국무위원석을 떠나서 다른 자리로 가세요.  다음은 노동부장관 나오셔서 답변해 주시기 바랍니다. 조성준 의원님 보충질문에 답변 올리겠습니다.  앞에서 AIDS환자 60명과 나병 이환자 3명, 63명은 이미 출국조치되어 있습니다. 현재 법정전염병 이환자는 없는 것으로 판단이 되고 있습니다.  다만 10만 명에 상당하는 불법체류자의 경우에는 현실적으로 검진이 어렵기 때문에 그 문제를 보완해야 하는 문제점을 안고 있습니다.  또 의원님이 말씀하신 63명이 어떤 사람을 대상으로 해서 조사가 되었느냐, 조사 시기가 언제냐 하는 것은 죄송합니다마는 이것은 보건복지부에서 관장을 했기 때문에 내용을 파악을 해서 저희 환경노동위원회에서 상세하게 서면으로 보고드리도록 하겠습니다.  감사합니다. 마지막으로 공보처장관 나오셔서 답변해 주시기 바랍니다. 공보처장관 답변드리겠습니다.  신기남 의원께서는 방송국의 인․허가권을 방송위에 두는 것이 위헌론이라는 논거가 무엇이냐는 그런 취지의 보충질문을 하셨습니다.  저희들 생각에는 방송위원회를 헌법기관으로 만든다면 하자가 없을 것이다 그렇게 보고 있습니다. 현행 헌법상 3권분립체제 아래서는 방송위원회에 행정 고유권한을 이관하는 것은 여러 가지로 문제가 있다 그런 말씀을 드린 것입니다. 미국의 FCC가 대통령 직속기구인 행정위원회라는 점에서 우리나라의 행정위원회와는 여러 가지로 다른 점이 있다 이런 말씀을 드리고 있는 것입니다. 자세한 것은 서면으로 정리를 해서 신 의원께 보내 올리도록 그렇게 하겠습니다.  그다음에 신 의원께서는 광고방송공사와 관련해서 공보처 출신이 진출해 있는 실태 같은 것을 자세하게 답변해 달라고 말씀을 하셨습니다. 양해해 주신다면 자세하게 서면으로 정리해서 보내 올리도록 하겠습니다.  감사합니다.', 'context_learn': '방송 인․허가권을 공보처에 주는 것의 위헌 여부에 대한 신기남 의원의 의견이 강조됩니다. 의원은 현재의 방식이 언론의 자유를 침해하고, 사실상의 검열과 허가 역할을 하고 있다며 문제를 제기하고 있습니다. 이에 대해 공보처장관은 헌법기관으로서의 방송위원회 구성이라면 위헌의 여지가 없을 것이라고 언급했습니다. 장관은 미국의 연방통신위원회(FCC)를 예로 들며 그것이 대통령 직속 행정위원회로서 우리나라와는 다르다고 설명합니다. 더불어 신 의원이 언급한 공보처 출신 관료들의 문제점과 정부 방침 홍보에 공익자금이 사용되고 있는 상황에 대해서 자세한 해명이 필요하다는 지적에 대해서는, 공보처장관은 보다 상세한 내용을 서면으로 정리하여 의원에게 제공하겠다고 답변했습니다. 이러한 대응은 방송 인․허가 과정에서의 투명성을 요구하는 신 의원의 주장과 정부의 방침 사이에서 이해와 접점을 찾으려는 시도로 볼 수 있습니다.', 'context_summary': {'summary_q': '방송 인허가권을 공보처에 주는 것이 위헌인지에 대한 의견을 다시 강조하면서, 왜 공보처 출신 관료로 채워진 공익자금을 이용해 정부방침 홍보에 활용되는지에 대한 설명을 요청합니다.', 'summary_a': '방송위원회를 헌법기관으로 만들면 문제가 없을 것으로 생각하며, 미국의 FCC와의 차이점을 설명하는 자세한 내용은 서면으로 정리하여 제출하겠습니다.'}, 'questioner_name': '신기남', 'questioner_ID': '3109', 'questioner_ISNI': '0000000463653586', 'questioner_affiliation': '', 'questioner_position': '의원', 'question': {'tag': '64', 'comment': '국무총리와 국무위원들의 답변이 대체로 보면 여당의원들의 질문에 대해서는 굉장히 상세하게 하면서 야당의원들의 발언은 그냥 한마디로 지나가 버려요. 아마 그 기회를 기다렸다는 듯이 정부의 방침을 홍보하는 데 많이 사용하시는 것 같아요. 그래서 상당히 실망이 컸습니다.  그런 관례는 빨리 좀 없어졌으면 좋겠습니다.  먼저 제 발언내용 중에서 잘못된 부분을 수정하겠습니다.  아까 워치콘3에서 워치콘2로 강화시켰다는 보도를 허위보도라고 제가 말했는데 그것을 과잉보도라는 말로 바꾸겠습니다.  제가 갖고 있는 자료상의 착오에서 비롯된 것입니다.  유엔사령부는 강화시켰다 이렇게만 발표했는데 대체적인 관례를 깨고 국방부에서 워치콘3에서 2로 바꾸었다고 발표를 해 버렸습니다. 이것은 대북감시체제라는 것은 보안유지를 해야 되는데 발표하는 것은 참 이례적인 일이라고 합니다. 그래서 유엔사에서 그것을 부인하고 나오는 그런 일이 벌어졌던 것입니다.  국방부의 발표는 경계태세가 몇 단계로 이루어졌든지 간에 국민에게 쓸데없이 위압감을 준 것으로서 올바르지 못한 그런 태도였습니다.  결국 언론은 국방부 발표대로 보도했으니까 허위보도라고 할 수는 없습니다.  그 보도내용에 문제가 있는 것은 사실이지만, 분명히 사실입니다. 그러나 국회의사록을 통해서 영원히 남을 제 발언에 정확성을 기하기 위해서 허위보도라는 대목을 과잉보도라는 것으로 제가 대체시키고자 합니다.  그다음에 공보처에 방송 인․허가권을 주는 것이 위헌이라는 저의 주장에 대해서 총리는 그렇게 생각하지 않는다고 말씀하시면서 아주 짤막한 답변을 하셨습니다. 법학자 특유의 논리로 설명해 주실 줄 알았는데 실망했습니다.  제가 법률가의 논리로 보충질문을 하겠습니다.  세계적으로 정부의 하나의 부처에 방송 인․허가권을 주는 예는 없는 것으로 알고 있습니다. 중동 몇 나라하고 공산국가밖에 없습니다.  우리나라가 중동, 공산국가가 될 수는 없는 것 아닙니까?
